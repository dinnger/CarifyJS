    <p>This is the story of the rather short journey it took to create the <a href="#">Profilo</a> website using
      Docusaurus.</p>

    <p>Profilo, an Android library for collecting performance traces from production, <a href="#">was announced</a>
      earlier this year. The project was <a href="#">published on GitHub</a> with a less than <a href="#">a handful or
        Markdown files</a> to describe its functionality and no website to showcase any branding and highlight the logo.
      The task at hand was to turn these existing docs and logo into a website.</p>

    <h2>Overview of Steps Taken</h2>
    <p>Here's a quick overview of the steps I took to convert Profilo to use Docusaurus:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First, I installed the latest version of Docusaurus</li>
      <li>Then, I configured the site settings</li>
      <li>Next, I imported all existing markdown documentation</li>
      <li>Finally, I customized the styling to match Profilo's brand</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>The design was kept simple and focused on readability. I used the default Docusaurus theme with minimal
      customization to ensure consistency with other Facebook open source projects.</p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Converting Profilo to Docusaurus took less than 2 hours from start to finish. The ease of setup and the quality
      of the documentation made this process remarkably smooth.</p>
